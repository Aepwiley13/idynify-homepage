# Idynify MVP Vision Document

## What the App Does

Idynify eliminates wasted sales effort by helping B2B companies identify and target their perfect-fit customers. Users complete a comprehensive questionnaire about their business, and our AI (Barry) generates a custom Ideal Customer Profile with actionable intelligence—scoring frameworks, messaging templates, and channel strategies—delivered to a private dashboard in 48 hours.

## Key Users

**Primary:** B2B founders, sales leaders, and growth professionals at early-stage to mid-market companies ($1M-$50M revenue) who:
- Are wasting time on bad-fit leads
- Don't have a clear ICP or it's outdated
- Need to improve conversion rates and sales efficiency
- Can't afford $5K-$50K consultants

**Secondary:** Marketing leaders who need better targeting for campaigns and content strategy.
